At present, the google search happens for the first two sentences in the markdown cells text i.e. the function checks for the length of each markdown cell text, if the number of sentences is equal to 1, the driver takes that sentence as the input and scrapes the first two links in the first page of the sentence search. If the length of markdown text is greater than 1, meaning there are multiple sentences in a markdown text, the function takes the first sentence in the markdown text and scrapes the first two links in the first page of the sentence search. The function google searches the sites [jovian.ai](https://jovian.ai/), [kaggle.com](https://kaggle.com/), and [github.com](https://github.com/) for a match and returns the appened list of matching links.\n- `check_matching_sentences(markdown_list,pages_links)` function takes the markdown list from `get_markdown_list(url)` and pages links from `get_matching_results(markdown_list)` as the inputs. The function scrapes all the markdown content in each matching link and looks for the sentence match of the input jovian url. If there is any match, it prints the matching url or else the loop breaks\n- `getting_matching_links(url)` is the final function that uses `get_markdown_list(url)`, `get_matching_results(markdown_list)` and `check_matching_sentences(markdown_list,pages_links)` functions with the jovian notebook link as input and returns the possible matching links."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e48d4362","metadata":{},"source":["## Installations &
